## Project Goals
In this project, I wanted to query a large database of country population sizes split by age group to extract the middle countries with populations between 10,000,000 and 100,000,000. Applied, I would use this query and API to grab current country population data for further analysis. 

## Tools
For this project, I worked with Google BigQuery to create a database and queried that database using SQL and BigQuery's REST API.
